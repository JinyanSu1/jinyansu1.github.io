Hi, I am Jinyan, currently a second year CS PhD student at Cornell university advised by [Claire Cardie](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/cardie/).

<!-- <span style="color:red; font-weight:bold">I will be graduating with my PhD in Spring 2026 and am actively seeking full-time research positions.</span> -->





**Research interest**: I am currently interested
- **LLM reasoning**: how to improve LLM to think and solve complex problem such as math and coding; understanding the relationship of reasoning length and correctness; reduce reasoning redundancy
- **Retrieval augmented generation**: how to design better and controlable RAG system to fit for different user cases and balance factual correctness and contextual correctness. (Check out my latest work in evaluating the robustness of RAG system when poisoning rag corpus [Eval-PoisonRAG](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16708) and user customizable adaptive retrieval [Flare-Aug](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.12145v1))



In the past, I worked on safe and responsible use of AI from both theoretical and empirial side.
