Hi, I am Jinyan, currently a second year CS PhD student at Cornell university advised by [Claire Cardie](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/cardie/). I was fortunate to work with [Wen Sun](https://wensun.github.io/) and [Sarah Dean](https://sdean.website/) on understanding dynamics in machine learning systems, inspired by applications such as recommendation system. 



**Research interest**: I am currently interested
- **LLM reasoning**: how to improve LLM to think and solve complext problem such as math and coding. 
- **LLM personalization**: how to personalize LLM without using resource intensive approaches such as fine-tuning. 
- **Retrieval augmented generation**: how to design better and controlable RAG system to fit for different user cases and balance factual correctness and contextual correctness. (Check out my [latest work](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16708))



In the past, I worked on safe and responsible use of AI/LLM, including 
- Design safe exploration algorithm that use human expert oversight to ensure a safe and responsible decision making. (see [MixUCB](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12DWE7vl3PaWEbSrYI71ldG_9fnKgihBX/view?usp=sharing) )

- Design algorithms that are tailored to diverse user preferences (see [MSGD](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.01481))

- Safeguard AI from misuse such as spreading misinformation, for example, I design algorithm and build benchmarks such as [M4](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14902) and [M4GT-Bench](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11175), and methods such as [DetectLLM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.05540.pdf) for detecting machine generated texts, and [fake news detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.04917), as well as [corpus attack on retrieval system](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.05087). 

- Design machine learning algorithms that are differentially private (See works such as [Fast DPSCO](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v167/su22a/su22a.pdf), [Non-interactive LDP](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v189/su23a/su23a.pdf); [DPSCO in non-Euclidean space](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v216/su23b/su23b.pdf))

## Misc
I used to delete my past a lot, because of my obsession in perfectionism, now, I learned to accept my imperfect past, and share to the world, my imperfect past and those struggling might make a small ripple on someone else's life.
