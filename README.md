Hi, I am Jinyan, a final year CS PhD student at Cornell university advised by [Claire Cardie](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/cardie/).

<span style="color:red; font-weight:bold"> I will be graduating in 2026 and am actively seeking full-time positions in industry. </span> 





**Research interest**: 
- **Efficiency and Budget Aware Agent**: How to design agentic frameworks that is efficient and adaptive under budget constraint(such as thinking budget, tool call budget or interaction turn budget). Specifically, for math problem, it means reduce thinking token and prevent the model from overthinking. For deep research, it means given the budget of tool calls (such as search), teach model to use these tool call budget wisely. For AI assisant, especially when user query is ambiguous, it means asking the right question and know when to stop asking for clarifying questions.  
- **Alignment and Safety**: I am interested in understanding, control LLM and agent behavior. Additionally, as agentic system becomes more and more powerful, human verification of the traces (which are usually super long) are not feasible, how can we verify agent get to the answer through the right path so that we can trust the answer? 
- **Using Agent to Accelerate scientific Discovery**: How can we build better agent scientist that can help human scientist to accelerate scientific discovery? How to verify that the scientific discovery from the agent is actually correct?
