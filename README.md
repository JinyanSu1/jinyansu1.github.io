Hi, I am Jinyan, a final year CS PhD student at Cornell university advised by [Claire Cardie](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/cardie/).

<span style="color:red; font-weight:bold">I will be graduating in Spring 2026 and am actively seeking full-time positions in industry. </span> 





**Research interest**: 
- **LLM reasoning**: how to improve LLM to think and solve complex problem such as math and coding; understanding the relationship of reasoning length and correctness; reduce reasoning redundancy
- **Retrieval augmented generation**: how to design better and controlable RAG system to fit for different user cases and balance factual correctness and contextual correctness. 


In the past, I worked on safe and responsible use of AI from both theoretical and empirial side.
