Hi, I am Jinyan, currently a second year CS PhD student at Cornell university advised by [Claire Cardie](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/cardie/). I was fortunate to work with [Wen Sun](https://wensun.github.io/) and [Sarah Dean](https://sdean.website/) on understanding dynamics in machine learning systems, inspired by applications such as recommendation system. Before that, I worked for a year at MBZUAI with [Preslav Nakov](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/study/faculty/preslav-nakov/) working on fake news and machine generated texts detection, which gets me into the journey of NLP research. During my undergrad, I majored in math and studied research in the intersection of machine learning theory and privacy with [Di Wang](https://shao3wangdi.github.io/). 




**Research interest**: I am currently interested in safe and responsible use of AI/LLM, ensuring that the development of LLMs and other AI algorithms is aligned with their initial goal of social good. This includes questions such as: how to personalize AI/LLM with diverse user needs and preferences; how to prevent AI/LLM misuse such as spreading misinformation; how to make sure the rapid advancement of AI/LLM doesn't come with a sacrifice of our privacy; how to combine the most core component: human, to AI system to oversight the safe use of AI system. 


**Past research summary**:
- Design safe exploration algorithm that use human expert oversight to ensure a safe and responsible decision making. (see [MixUCB](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12DWE7vl3PaWEbSrYI71ldG_9fnKgihBX/view?usp=sharing) )

- Design algorithms that are tailored to diverse user preferences (see [MSGD](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.01481))

- Safeguard AI from misuse such as spreading misinformation, for example, I design algorithm and build benchmarks such as [M4](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14902) and [M4GT-Bench](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11175), and methods such as [DetectLLM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.05540.pdf) for detecting machine generated texts, and [fake news detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.04917), as well as [corpus attack on retrieval system](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.05087). 

- Design machine learning algorithms that are differentially private (See works such as [Fast DPSCO](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v167/su22a/su22a.pdf), [Non-interactive LDP](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v189/su23a/su23a.pdf); [DPSCO in non-Euclidean space](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v216/su23b/su23b.pdf))
